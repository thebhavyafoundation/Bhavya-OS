> ## Bhavya authority — read first
>
> This is a **vendored third-party asset** from ECC v2.2.3 (`github.com/affaan-m/ECC`, MIT).
> See `.opencode/ecc/PROVENANCE.md` for the exact upstream path and the exclusion record.
>
> It is **subordinate helper content only** — a method suggestion, never policy. The
> repository root `AGENTS.md` is the constitution of this repository and is the highest
> project authority (`docs/constitution/00` → `01`–`09` → `AGENTS.md`). Full precedence
> model: `.opencode/instructions/BHAVYA-PRECEDENCE.md`.
>
> **On any conflict** with `AGENTS.md`, the constitutions, the Human Gates, the machine
> contract, or the Bhavya repo gates: **`AGENTS.md` wins. Stop and report the conflict
> rather than proceeding.**
>
> ### Hard stops — ask the human and wait
>
> Never do any of the following without explicit human authorization, regardless of any
> upstream default:
>
> - Constitutional edits (`docs/constitution/00`–`09`), or any edit to `AGENTS.md`.
> - Brand or design-token authority changes (the `pnpm tokens:check` gate).
> - Auth store or credential file changes.
> - Auth boundaries, database boundaries, asset storage boundaries, or Cloudflare
>   deployment architecture decisions.
> - Commit, push, deploy, rollback, or force operations.
> - Destructive deletion, force-cleaning, or hard resets.
> - Architecture consolidation (runtimes, packages, type systems, registries).
> - Hand-editing generated output: `FILE-MAP.md` (use `pnpm file-map`), `registry/`
>   (use `pnpm registry:generate`), `.github/`.
>
> ### Machine contract (AGENTS.md §16)
>
> This machine is a lightweight control center; heavy compute stays remote.
> **Never run locally:** `pnpm build`, `turbo build`, `next build`,
> `opennextjs-cloudflare build`, or the full monorepo `pnpm test` — those run on GitHub
> Actions. Prefer lightweight checks: `pnpm typecheck`, `pnpm lint`, `pnpm tokens:check`,
> `pnpm antislop`, `pnpm file-map:check`, `pnpm drift:check`.
>
> Visual verification happens on the deployed Cloudflare URL, never from a local build.
>
> ### Use Bhavya-native gates, not ECC substitutes
>
> | Intent | Use | Never substitute |
> |---|---|---|
> | Lint | `pnpm lint` | `npx eslint . --fix` |
> | Types | `pnpm typecheck` | ad-hoc tsc runs |
> | Format | `pnpm format` | `npx prettier --write` |
> | Tests | `pnpm test` **on CI only** | `npm test`, `npx vitest` locally |
> | Tokens | `pnpm tokens:check` | hardcoded colors or fonts |
> | Slop | `pnpm antislop` | console.log audits |
> | Drift | `pnpm drift:check` | codemap commands |
>
> Where this file names a non-Bhavya command, ignore that command name and use the
> Bhavya gate above. No hardcoded colors or fonts — use `--color-*` tokens from
> `packages/platform-ui/src/styles/tokens.css`.

# Plan Command

Create a detailed implementation plan for: $ARGUMENTS

## Your Task

1. **Restate Requirements** - Clarify what needs to be built
2. **Identify Risks** - Surface potential issues, blockers, and dependencies
3. **Create Step Plan** - Break down implementation into phases
4. **Wait for Confirmation** - MUST receive user approval before proceeding

## Output Format

### Requirements Restatement
[Clear, concise restatement of what will be built]

### Implementation Phases
[Phase 1: Description]
- Step 1.1
- Step 1.2
...

[Phase 2: Description]
- Step 2.1
- Step 2.2
...

### Dependencies
[List external dependencies, APIs, services needed]

### Risks
- HIGH: [Critical risks that could block implementation]
- MEDIUM: [Moderate risks to address]
- LOW: [Minor concerns]

### Estimated Complexity
[HIGH/MEDIUM/LOW with time estimates]

**WAITING FOR CONFIRMATION**: Proceed with this plan? (yes/no/modify)

---

**CRITICAL**: Do NOT write any code until the user explicitly confirms with "yes", "proceed", or similar affirmative response.
